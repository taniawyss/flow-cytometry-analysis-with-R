## R for Data Science Book

Book (2nd edition) by Hadley Wickham (a very active R developer), Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel and Garrett Grolemund. The book makes heavy use of the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/), which is a collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. ggplot2 is part of the tidyverse packages.
